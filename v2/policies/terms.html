  <h2 id="terms-title">Terms of Service</h2>
  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 04 October 2025</p>
  <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the Viviane Talents website and any related recruitment or advisory services (collectively, the "Services"). By accessing or using the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>

  <h3>1. Who We Are</h3>
  <p>Viviane Talents ("we", "us", "our") is a recruitment and talent advisory studio that sources and evaluates candidates for client organizations and provides strategic hiring support.</p>

  <h3>2. Eligibility</h3>
  <p>You represent that you are (a) at least the age of majority in your jurisdiction and (b) using the Services for legitimate professional or business purposes. If you access on behalf of an organization, you confirm you have authority to bind that organization.</p>

  <h3>3. Nature of the Service</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>For Clients:</strong> We conduct research, sourcing, pre-screening, and coordination. Final hiring decisions remain solely with the client.</li>
    <li><strong>For Candidates:</strong> We may evaluate profile suitability, present opportunities, and facilitate introductions. We do not guarantee placement, employment terms, compensation, or timing.</li>
    <li><strong>No Employment Creation:</strong> Use of the Services does not create an employment or partnership relationship with us.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>4. User Responsibilities</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide accurate, current, and non-misleading information.</li>
    <li>Do not upload or transmit unlawful, defamatory, discriminatory, infringing, or confidential third‑party materials without authorization.</li>
    <li>Do not attempt to probe, scan, compromise, or disrupt the security or integrity of systems.</li>
    <li>Respect all applicable laws, including data protection and professional confidentiality obligations.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>5. Intellectual Property</h3>
  <p>The Services (including text, design, layout, branding, and internal methodologies) are owned or licensed by us and protected by applicable intellectual property laws. You receive no license except the limited right to access and use the site for legitimate evaluation of our Services. All client or candidate materials remain their respective property.</p>

  <h3>6. Confidentiality</h3>
  <p>Information shared in the context of recruitment (candidate CVs, compensation data, business plans, hiring strategies) may be confidential. You agree to protect such information and use it only for the intended evaluation purpose. You must not re-disclose candidate details to third parties without appropriate legal basis and consent.</p>

  <h3>7. Data Protection & Privacy</h3>
  <p>Use of personal data is governed by our <a href="#" data-policy="policies/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>. By providing personal information, you acknowledge its processing as described there. You are responsible for ensuring you have authority to share any third-party data (e.g., referrals).</p>

  <h3>8. Third-Party Links & Tools</h3>
  <p>External links (LinkedIn, GitHub, Telegram, etc.) are provided for convenience only. We do not endorse nor accept responsibility for third-party content, policies, or security practices.</p>

  <h3>9. Disclaimers</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The Services are provided on an <strong>"AS IS"</strong> and <strong>"AS AVAILABLE"</strong> basis.</li>
    <li>We disclaim warranties of fitness for a particular purpose, accuracy, uninterrupted availability, or non-infringement to the fullest extent permitted by law.</li>
    <li>We do not guarantee hiring outcomes, time-to-fill, candidate acceptance, performance, or retention metrics.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>10. Limitation of Liability</h3>
  <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, in no event shall we be liable for indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, or punitive damages; lost profits; loss of data; business interruption; or reputational harm arising out of or relating to the Services. Aggregate direct liability shall not exceed EUR 1,000 (or equivalent) unless a separate written agreement states otherwise. Some jurisdictions do not allow certain exclusions; in such cases, the limitation applies to the greatest extent permitted.</p>

  <h3>11. Indemnification</h3>
  <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Viviane Talents, its directors, personnel, and affiliates from claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising from: (a) your misuse of the Services; (b) violation of these Terms; or (c) infringement or misappropriation of third-party rights.</p>

  <h3>12. Suspension & Termination</h3>
  <p>We may suspend or terminate access (temporary or permanent) if we believe there is (a) violation of these Terms, (b) unlawful activity, (c) security risk, or (d) risk of harm to candidates, clients, or our reputation. Sections intended to survive (e.g., IP, confidentiality, disclaimers, liability limits) remain in effect after termination.</p>

  <h3>13. Changes to the Terms</h3>
  <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. Material changes may be signaled via notice on the site. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance. The “Last Updated” date reflects the latest revision.</p>

  <h3>14. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution</h3>
  <p>Unless superseded by a signed master services agreement, these Terms are governed by the substantive laws of the jurisdiction in which we principally operate (excluding its conflict of law rules). Disputes shall first be addressed in good-faith negotiations. If unresolved, the dispute may be submitted to competent courts of that principal jurisdiction. Mandatory consumer or local statutory rights remain unaffected where applicable.</p>

  <h3>15. No Waiver & Severability</h3>
  <p>Failure to enforce any provision is not a waiver. If any provision is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in force, and a valid provision closest to the original intent shall be substituted.</p>

  <h3>16. Priority of Agreements</h3>
  <p>Where a fully executed written services, recruitment, or retained search agreement exists between you and us, that agreement prevails over conflicting terms here.</p>
