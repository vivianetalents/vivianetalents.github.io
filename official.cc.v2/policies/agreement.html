  <h2 id="client-agreement-title">Client Service Agreement (Summary)</h2>
  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 04 October 2025</p>
  <p>This summary describes typical commercial and operational principles under which Viviane Talents ("we", "us", "our") provides recruitment and talent advisory services to client organizations ("Client"). A definitive engagement requires a mutually executed Master Services Agreement, Letter of Engagement, or Statement of Work (collectively, the "Formal Agreement"). In case of conflict, the Formal Agreement prevails.</p>

  <h3>1. Services</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Scope:</strong> Talent research, role profiling, sourcing, screening, shortlist presentation, candidate coordination, feedback facilitation, offer guidance, and advisory insights.</li>
    <li><strong>Exclusions:</strong> Legal employment decisions, payroll, immigration sponsorship, or post-hire HR administration unless expressly agreed.</li>
    <li><strong>Customization:</strong> Role-specific deliverables documented in a Statement of Work (SOW) or email confirmation (interim) pending signature.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2. Client Responsibilities</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide accurate role descriptions, selection criteria, compensation bands, and decision timelines.</li>
    <li>Offer timely feedback (ideally within 2–5 business days of candidate submission or interview).</li>
    <li>Inform promptly of internal changes impacting the search (headcount freeze, reprioritization, etc.).</li>
    <li>Respect candidate confidentiality and data protection obligations.</li>
    <li>Avoid direct circumvention of presented candidates outside the agreed process.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3. Candidate Ownership</h3>
  <p>Unless otherwise agreed, a candidate introduced by us is considered an "Introduced Candidate" for an ownership period (commonly 6–12 months) from first documented submission. Hires (or engagements in a substantially similar role) within that period typically trigger the agreed fee.</p>

  <h3>4. Fees & Payment</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Models:</strong> Retained, container / hybrid, or success-based contingency, as defined in the Formal Agreement.</li>
    <li><strong>Structure:</strong> Retained: staged installments (e.g., kickoff / shortlist / acceptance). Contingency: invoice upon signed offer or start.</li>
    <li><strong>Currency & Taxes:</strong> Fees excluding applicable VAT / GST / sales taxes unless stated.</li>
    <li><strong>Payment Terms:</strong> Standard net 14–30 days from invoice date unless negotiated.</li>
    <li><strong>Late Payment:</strong> May accrue interest at statutory or agreed rates and/or suspend active work.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>5. Replacement / Guarantee (If Applicable)</h3>
  <p>Where included, a one-time replacement or pro‑rated credit may apply if an Introduced Candidate voluntarily resigns or is terminated for performance within an agreed guarantee period (commonly 60–90 days from start). Guarantee void if: (a) invoice unpaid on time; (b) role materially altered; (c) redundancy / restructuring; (d) misconduct unrelated to recruitment suitability; (e) Client hires alternative candidate sourced independently before replacement search begins.</p>

  <h3>6. Confidentiality</h3>
  <p>Both parties agree to keep non-public business, candidate information, compensation data, and strategic materials confidential and to use them solely for the engagement. Each party implements reasonable safeguards and limits internal access on a need-to-know basis.</p>

  <h3>7. Data Protection</h3>
  <p>Processing of personal data is performed in alignment with our <a href="#" data-policy="policies/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> and applicable data protection laws. Client warrants it has lawful basis to receive and evaluate candidate data, and will ensure internal handling meets regulatory standards.</p>

  <h3>8. Non-Solicitation (Optional)</h3>
  <p>We may agree not to proactively recruit Client’s employees for a defined cooling-off period post-engagement (commonly 6–12 months), subject to: (a) employees applying independently; (b) broad-market campaigns not targeted at Client; (c) employees listed in public layoffs. Any such clause must be explicitly stated in the Formal Agreement.</p>

  <h3>9. Intellectual Property</h3>
  <p>Research frameworks, methodologies, market maps, and process templates remain our intellectual property. Client receives a non-exclusive right to use delivered candidate materials for internal evaluation only.</p>

  <h3>10. Limitation of Liability</h3>
  <p>To the extent permitted by law, neither party is liable for indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages (lost profits, opportunity cost, reputational harm). Aggregate direct liability is typically capped at the lesser of (a) total fees paid in the prior 12 months or (b) a stated monetary cap, except for: (i) willful misconduct; (ii) confidentiality or data protection breaches; (iii) unpaid fees.</p>

  <h3>11. Term & Termination</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Term:</strong> Begins upon written confirmation or execution of the Formal Agreement.</li>
    <li><strong>Termination for Convenience:</strong> Either party may terminate with written notice (e.g., 7–14 days) unless under a retained or exclusive lock-in phase.</li>
    <li><strong>Termination for Cause:</strong> Material breach not cured within a reasonable cure period (often 10–15 days) triggers termination rights.</li>
    <li><strong>Effect:</strong> Candidate ownership and accrued payment obligations survive termination.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>12. Force Majeure</h3>
  <p>Neither party is liable for delay or failure caused by events beyond reasonable control (e.g., natural disasters, government action, infrastructural outages) provided timely notice and mitigation efforts.</p>

  <h3>13. Dispute Resolution</h3>
  <p>Parties will attempt good-faith resolution via senior-level discussion before escalation. Failing resolution, disputes may proceed to courts of the governing jurisdiction specified in the Formal Agreement.</p>

  <h3>14. Governing Law</h3>
  <p>Defined in the Formal Agreement. Absent such specification, governed by the substantive law of the principal place of business of Viviane Talents (excluding conflict rules), subject to mandatory local statutes.</p>

  <h3>15. Amendments</h3>
  <p>Changes are valid only if documented in writing (email confirmation may serve for interim operational tweaks pending formal addendum).</p>

  <h3>16. Priority & Entire Agreement</h3>
  <p>This summary is informational. The Formal Agreement (with annexes, SOWs, or order forms) constitutes the entire agreement regarding Services and supersedes prior informal proposals or discussions.</p>
