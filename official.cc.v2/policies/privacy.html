  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 04 October 2025</p>
  <p>Viviane Talents ("we", "us", "our") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect personal data when you interact with our website, engage our recruitment or talent advisory services, communicate with us, or otherwise provide information.

  <p>We do <strong>not</strong> intentionally collect special categories of personal data (e.g., health, racial origin, biometric data) unless you voluntarily provide it and it is relevant and lawful to process for recruitment purposes. Please avoid sharing unnecessary sensitive data.</p>

  <h3>3. Sources of Personal Data</h3>

    <li>Referrals from clients, partners, or professional contacts (with appropriate assurances).</li>
    <li>Service providers (e.g., analytics or communication tools) generating usage metrics.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>4. Legal Bases for Processing (EEA / UK / Similar Regimes)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Contract Performance:</strong> To provide recruitment and advisory services to clients or to evaluate your candidacy.</li>
    <li><strong>Legitimate Interests:</strong> Deliver and improve services; source candidates; ensure platform security; maintain business records; prevent fraud; build professional networks—balanced against your rights.</li>
    <li><strong>Consent:</strong> When required (e.g., retaining your profile for future opportunities, certain marketing communications). You may withdraw consent at any time.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal Obligations:</strong> Regulatory, tax, accounting, compliance, or lawful authority requests.</li>
    <li><strong>Pre-Contractual Steps:</strong> At your request prior to entering an engagement (e.g., candidate evaluation or proposal stage).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>5. How We Use Personal Data</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Evaluate and match candidates to client roles or internal opportunities.</li>
    <li>Communicate with candidates and clients (updates, feedback, coordination).</li>
    <li>Provide and tailor recruitment advisory services.</li>
    <li>Maintain records of searches, placements, and performance metrics.</li>

    <li>With consent: retain profiles for future roles or send curated updates.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>6. Cookies & Tracking Technologies</h3>
  <p>Our current implementation is minimal and may use only essential or low-intensity analytics (e.g., server logs or privacy-centric metrics) to understand site performance and mitigate abuse. If additional tracking (e.g., marketing pixels) is introduced, we will update this Policy and, where required, present a consent mechanism.</p>

  <h3>7. Disclosures & Sharing of Personal Data</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Clients:</strong> Relevant candidate information shared for role evaluation after suitability screening.</li>
    <li><strong>Service Providers / Processors:</strong> Hosting, secure file storage, communication, or analytics providers under contractual confidentiality and data protection obligations.</li>
    <li><strong>Professional Advisors:</strong> Legal, accounting, compliance consultants (as necessary).</li>
    <li><strong>Corporate Transactions:</strong> Business restructuring, merger, acquisition, or asset transfer (subject to safeguards).</li>
    <li><strong>Legal / Regulatory:</strong> When required by applicable law or valid legal process, or to protect rights, safety, or security.</li>
    <li><strong>Aggregated / Anonymized Data:</strong> Insights that do not identify individuals.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not sell personal data. We do not permit unauthorized third-party direct marketing using your details.</p>

  <h3>8. International Data Transfers</h3>
  <p>Because we serve clients and candidates across jurisdictions, data may be transferred and stored in countries with different data protection standards. Where required, we implement appropriate safeguards (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses, contractual assurances, or equivalent legal mechanisms). By providing information, you acknowledge such transfers subject to applicable law.</p>

  <h3>9. Data Retention</h3>
  <p>We retain personal data only as long as necessary for the purposes described or as required by law, accounting standards, or legitimate business needs. Typical retention factors include: (a) duration of active search or client engagement; (b) potential future relevance of a candidate’s profile; (c) legal limitation periods; (d) regulatory obligations. Upon expiry of retention criteria, data is securely deleted, anonymized, or archived (where legally justified). You may request earlier deletion where applicable (see Rights section).</p>

  <h3>10. Data Security</h3>
  <p>We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures: controlled access, principle of least privilege, encryption at rest/transport (where supported), limited internal distribution, and monitoring for anomalous activity. No system is 100% secure; we encourage you to avoid sending highly sensitive information unless absolutely necessary.</p>

  <h3>11. Your Rights</h3>
  <p>Depending on jurisdiction, you may have rights to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Access your personal data and receive a copy.</li>
    <li>Correct inaccurate or incomplete data.</li>
    <li>Request deletion (erasure) subject to legal constraints.</li>
    <li>Restrict or object to certain processing (especially where based on legitimate interests or direct marketing).</li>
    <li>Data portability (structured, commonly used, machine-readable format).</li>
    <li>Withdraw consent (where processing relies on consent) without affecting prior lawful processing.</li>
    <li>Lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority (e.g., an EU/UK data protection authority).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>To exercise rights, contact us using the details in the Contact section. We may request verification to protect confidentiality. We respond within applicable statutory timeframes.</p>

  <h3>12. Candidate Profiles & Future Opportunities</h3>
  <p>If we consider that your profile may align with future roles, we may (with legitimate interest or consent where required) retain core professional data. You can opt out or request deletion at any time.</p>

  <h3>13. Children</h3>
  <p>Our services target professional recruitment and are not directed to children. We do not knowingly collect personal data from individuals under the minimum applicable working or digital consent age. If you believe such data was provided, contact us for removal.</p>

  <h3>14. Third-Party Links</h3>
  <p>Our site may reference third-party platforms (e.g., LinkedIn, GitHub, Telegram). Interactions with those platforms are governed by their respective privacy policies, not this one.</p>

  <h3>15. Changes to This Policy</h3>
  <p>We may update this Policy to reflect operational, legal, or regulatory changes. The "Last Updated" date will be revised. Significant changes may be communicated via website notice or direct message where feasible.</p>
