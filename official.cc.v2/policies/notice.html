  <h3>7. International Transfers</h3>

  <h3>8. Retention</h3>
  <p>We retain candidate data while (a) an active process is ongoing; (b) there is a reasonable prospect of relevant future opportunities; or (c) necessary for legal or operational requirements. Typical review cycles occur every 18–24 months to identify profiles for archival or deletion. You may request earlier deletion unless overriding legitimate grounds or legal obligations apply.</p>

  <h3>9. Your Rights</h3>
  <p>Subject to jurisdiction: access; rectification; erasure; restriction; objection (especially to legitimate interest–based processing); portability; withdrawal of consent; complaint to a supervisory authority. See contact section to exercise these rights—verification may be required.</p>

  <h3>10. Automated Decision-Making</h3>
  <p>We do not use solely automated decision-making producing legal or similarly significant effects. Limited ranking or filtering tools may assist preliminary triage, always followed by human review.</p>

  <h3>11. Security Measures</h3>
  <p>Least‑privilege access, encrypted transit, structured note hygiene, internal confidentiality guidelines, and periodic review. No system is infallible—avoid transmitting excessive sensitive personal data.</p>

  <h3>12. Referrals</h3>
  <p>If you refer someone, share only professional contact details and confirm the individual would reasonably expect contact about relevant opportunities. We will provide this Notice to referred candidates at or before first meaningful engagement.</p>

  <h3>13. Withdrawing from Consideration</h3>
  <p>You may request: (a) pause; (b) exclusion from a specific client; (c) full removal (subject to legal retention). We log suppression flags to respect future preferences.</p>

  <h3>14. Updates to This Notice</h3>
